\title{Calculate Nu}
\usage{
getNu(alpha, conditionalPower)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The (conditional) type I error rate of the design. Must be a numeric vector with values between 0 and 1.}

\item{conditionalPower}{The target conditional power \eqn{CP} of the design. To guarantee that the function \code{getPsi()} can be solved, the conditional power should be between \code{1-pnorm(2)} and \code{pnorm(2)}. Must be a numeric value.}
}
\value{
Factor linking sample size and \eqn{\alpha_2}.
}
\description{
Calculate the factor which relates \eqn{\alpha_2} to a second-stage sample size for given conditional power.
}
\details{
Note that this function uses factor 1 instead of factor 2 (Brannath & Bauer 2004). This is done because the allocation ratio is not included in the calculation of nu here. This has no impact on the optimal conditional error function, as constant factors are absorbed by the level constant \eqn{c_0}. \cr
The calculation is:
\deqn{\nu(\alpha_2(p_1)) = (\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha_2(p_1)) + \Phi^{-1}(CP))^2.}
}
\examples{
getNu(alpha=0.05, conditionalPower=0.9)

# Returns 0 if alpha exceeds conditionalPower
getNu(alpha=0.8, conditionalPower=0.7)
